## Alpha-I-Class creatures

Generation One creature with instictual analogues

### Alpha-I Basic

Since ALPHA-I BASIC is the foundation to all other work, it is most important to understand how it works and what it means. If you are careless with your study and programming at
this point. I’m afraid you will have to pay for it dearly later on. Study the overall concept, the subroutines, and even the individual lines and statements carefully. They will all be used time and again in later programs, but without the benefit of extensive explanations.

#### The Nature of Alpha-I Basic

ALPHA-I BASIC is the simplest possible form of adaptive _machine intelligence_. The creature’s purpose is to move about in a well-defined environment, doing whatever it can to ensure free
dom of motion within that environment. Its responses are purely random in nature with only two restrictions upon its behavior. First, the creature must remain within the confines of its
environment, and second, it must not be allowed to stop moving. Both of these restrictions have their counterparts in the real world. The real world, for instance, does have barriers of some sort that limit the range of a creature’s activities. These might be physical barriers such as walls, the surface tension of a drop of water, the forces of gravity that confines creatures to the surface of a planet, or, in the most esoteric sense, the abstract confines of a 3-dimensional space and the forward-pointing arrow of time.

The creature represented by ALPHA-I BASIC is confined to a rectangular field drawn on the screen. All the creature ever perceives and does is restricted to the confines of this rectangle: Existence outside this world rectangle has no relevance whatsoever. The creature’s activities must be limited to the area enclosed by the rectangle. And, in the case of ALPHA-I BASIC, its total mode of behavior is one of avoiding the possibility of leaving that little world.

In fact, the purpose of the creature in ALPHA-I BASIC is to actively engage the barriers of its little world, and the need for actively engaging the barriers precludes the possibility of standing totally motionless. Motion is the essence of the creature's behavior and existence, and allowing it to stand motionless within its world defeats its purpose for being created in the first place.

As far as the ALPHA-I BASIC creature is concerned, the need to pursue continuous motion is built into its very nature. This will not be the case for some ALPHA-II and some of the
higher-order creatures: Standing motionless can, indeed, be a legitimate and useful response where the range of perceptions and modes of behavior are sufficiently complex. In a few words then, an ALPHA-I BASIC creature is characterized by continuous and random motion within the confines of a rectangle. Its purpose in "life" is to pursue freedom of motion, and the adaptive quality of its behavior is one of finding ways to keep moving in spite of changes in its barriers.

THE ALPHA-I BASIC SCREEN FORMAT

Figure 3-1 shows the screen format for the ALPHA-I BASIC experiments. It is simply a rectangle drawn on the screen and a small square representing the creature, itself. Incidentally, the drawing is shown here with blacks and whites reversed. The border and creature figures are both white against a black background. For the sake of showing clearer pictures, this convention is used throughout the entire book.

THE ALPHA-I BASIC FLOWCHART

The general flowchart for ALPHA-I BASIC is shown in Fig.3-2. It is a rather simple flowchart, but since it will be incorporated in virtually every experiment described in ±is book, it is
one worthy of some very close study at this time.

_Problem statement_

What is needed are dynamic, self-programming, general-purpose machines capable of setting and pursuing their own goals in the context of the world as _the machines, themselves, perceive it_. There, in it, we can state:

_Problem exploaration_

Dynamic (existence.Step()) self-programming machines (animals) capable (IExistence) of setting (existence0xx) and pursuing (interaction) their own goals (Experiment) in the context (Result) of the world as they-themselves perceive it.

_Discussion_

One further refinement that is entirely possible today is extending the Gamma-Class robot's level of self-awareness to the point where it can evaluate the responses it is learning. This Delta-Class robot assigns a certain confidence level to the responses it deems appropriate under certain environmental conditions. The solution to a problem that is solved by first-hand experience takes on a rather high confidence level. As in the case of a Gamma-Class robot, the machine generalizes its responses to first-hand solutions to similar conditions not yet encountered. This robot assignsa relatively low confidence level to these conditions.

_Easily taught_

So as the Delta-Class robot experiences events in its world, it evolves a hierarchy of responses having a high, medium, and low level of confidence. The machine, however, does not like responses with a low confidence level to exist within itself, so it sets out to encourage those events that call for a test of its responses gained by inference or second-hand generalization.

The delta-class machine might not be wholly successful in its attempts to set-up new environmental conditions, but it works at the job ceaselessly. It has a will of its own: It programs itself, setting goals aimed at enhancing its confidence in dealing with the world as it perceives it.

_Errata_

Given this level is only verbally described, effort toward its programmatic defnition and bounds is requisite.

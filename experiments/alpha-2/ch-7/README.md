## LOADING BASIC ALPHA-II

As mentioned several times through this chapter, the program ought to be built upon the ALPHA-I with scoring program and subroutines described in Chapter 4. You can save yourself a lot of time by loading that older program before you start making the revisions and additions required for ALPHA-II. Be sure to delete the entire ALPHA-I master program before entering its ALPHA-II counterpart. Otherwise you are going to end up with some unwanted program statements in the listing.

# Tests on debian12 linux machine

A self-contained folder to workout some of the aspects of EAMI to apply toward _metal_ in-lieu of _ideal_.

### Project notes

* 19.02.2024 - 1218: The version 2.5.2 of the TRS-80 emulator runs very nicely on this version of linux and good for long-running tests, which should be the focus of the effort such that there are reasonable publications to generate.

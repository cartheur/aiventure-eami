## The paper

The immediate output-goal of this project is to generate an analytical paper on the Heiserman Alpha-Beta behaviours to other kinds of currently-existing techniques. Ideally with an eye toward the adaptation paradigms of Ross Ashby and Gerd Sommerhoff, the VSM successes of Anthony Beer.

## The publisher

Open source most likely, given the publishers are goons.

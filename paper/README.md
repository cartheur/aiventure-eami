## The paper

The immediate output-goal of this project is to generate an analytical paper on the Heiserman Alpha-Beta behaviours to other kinds of currently-existing techniques. A performance and telelogical comparision. Target is techArxiv for the IEEE. Arxiv too but a publisher would be better.

This will be one of three papers.

## The publisher

On the way to them, start [here](https://www.techrxiv.org/f/about). A good way. A good way indeed, the issue is _always_ the affliation. But a whole chapter? Now how much does that cost? A cool two grand, really? Not going that route.

    1043: Working from aeon to aeon-fred-henry-delila to aiops to ideal to here (and in many ways haden and david) I am slowly realizing the only tactic I have in-hand is walking through a maze and doing shit, like a lab rat. What is being achieved here?

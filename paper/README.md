## The paper

The immediate output-goal of this project is to generate an analytical paper on the Heiserman Alpha-Beta behaviours to other kinds of currently-existing techniques. A performance and telelogical comparision. Target is techArxiv for the IEEE. Arxiv too but a publisher would be better. 

## The publisher

On the way to them, start [here](https://www.techrxiv.org/f/about). A good way. A good way indeed, the issue is _always_ the affliation.

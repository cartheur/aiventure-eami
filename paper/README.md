## The paper

The immediate output-goal of this project is to generate an analytical paper on the Heiserman Alpha-Beta behaviours to other kinds of currently-existing techniques. A performance and telelogical comparision. Target is techArxiv for the IEEE. Arxiv too but a publisher would be better.

This will be one of three papers.

## The publisher

On the way to them, start [here](https://www.techrxiv.org/f/about). A good way. A good way indeed, the issue is _always_ the affliation. But a whole chapter? Now how much does that cost? A cool two grand, really? Not going that route.

    1043: Working from aeon to aeon-fred-henry-delila to aiops to ideal to here (and in many ways haden and david) I am slowly realizing the only tactic I have in-hand is walking through a maze and doing shit, like a lab rat. What is being achieved here?
    1040: I _was totally_ right that this work by Heiserman is the state-of-the-art that has yet to be surpassed, at least via my experience and intellect. You got the chat/LLM problem-solving by English expressions to garner intent; the differential analyzer; a decider (homeostatic); array-contol of motors (of varying complexity); and _ideal_ that brings it all together into one output result expression. I know the C# version is the same as this with more detailed nomenclature on the parts, rather than PEEK and POKE as graphics movements not unlike the predator-prey theoretical model, so where to go from here? That is the ultimate question now.

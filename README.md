May the spirit of David Lee Heiserman guide the substance, flow, and outcomes of this open-source project.

This project is dedicated to the late David Heiserman (1940 - 2020) who wrote engineering books on many topics. However, the ones that stir the most interest in this context are those:

* How to build your own working robot (Buster, 1976)
* How to build your own self-progamming robot (Rodney, 1979)
* Robot intelligence with experience (1981)
* Projects in machine intelligence for your home computer (1982)
* Build your own working robot, the second generation (1987)

## What is here

Due to the age of the books and what computing hardware/software was state-of-the-art at the time of their printing, the demonstratable focus of Evolutionary-Adaptive Machine Intelligence (EAMI) is contained in Basic scripts run on the TRS-80 computer. 

## About the EAMI scripts

For the purposes of posterity, the scripts as written in these books have been captured in their original TRS-Basic scripts. In "machine intelligence for your home computer" (1982), there is also code in AppleBasic. As it is super-inconvient to try to assemble such a computer (the Rodney robot is certainly difficult enough), an amazing project by [George Phillips](http://48k.ca/trs80gp.html) that has a group on Discord is a TRS-80 emulator that allows running of the scripts. It runs in Linux, Windows, and Apple machines. By using the "Tandy Color Basic" VsCode extension, one can have the same programming experience as the modern languages.

## Working with the scripts

A recent Windows version used in past experiments (v.2.4.8) is contained in the emulator [folder](/emulator/trs80gp.exe). The most recent published version is contained in the zip archive and it contains the versions for the various platforms.

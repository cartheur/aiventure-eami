## How to use the runtime

Code from the experiments folder can be run using this emulator in the following at a terminal in VSCode:

```
..\aiventure-eami\runtime> .\trs80gp.exe .\04-alpha1-compilation.bas
```

Other files can be developed from Heiserman's 1981 and 1982 books respectively.

When adding new lines to the code files, it is pertinent to remind oneself that in BASIC, each new line must have a `REM` prefix. This is a good idea.
